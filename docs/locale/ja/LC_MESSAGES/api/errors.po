"When it comes to error handling, you can always directly set the error "
"status, appropriate response headers, and error body using the ``resp`` "
"object. However, Falcon tries to make things a little easier by providing"
" a set of error classes you can raise when something goes wrong. All of "
"these classes inherit from :class:`~.HTTPError`."

"Falcon will convert any instance or subclass of :class:`~.HTTPError` "
"raised by a responder, hook, or middleware component into an appropriate "
"HTTP response. The default error serializer supports both JSON and XML. "

"weight, JSON will be chosen. Other media types may be supported by "
"overriding the default serializer via :meth:`~.API.set_error_serializer`."
